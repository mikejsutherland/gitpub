About gitpub
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gitpub aims to be a simple to deploy, PHP based web application for hosting and 
navigating either local or remote git repositories. Gitpub provides a simple
interface which was inspired by the overall look and feel of github.

Features include:
    - File navigation
    - Commit history
    - Commit file diff
    - Branching
    - Tags


Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Apache with PHP support
- Git 1.7.4.x or above
- A directory containing git repos

Apache Notes:
    - None.

Git Notes:
    - This has not been tested on earlier versions of Git.

PHP Notes:
    - If your php installation makes use of open_basedir to restrict access
      to directories, you will need to append the path to the git bin and
      also to your projects directory where you house your repos.
